Task 1: Create the database on PGAdmin4

Databases(right click) > Create > Database > Choose/Create Database Name




Task 2: Create the world Table

Right Click on Database Name > Choose Query Editor > Input the following

CREATE TABLE world(city_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
		   avg_temp INTEGER NOT NULL,
		   avg_commute INTEGER NOT NULL,
		   happiness_ranking INTEGER PRIMARY KEY) 




Task 3: Import Data from .csv file for the table

Right Click on world > Choose Import/Export > Browse for the .csv file > Select the Header button in the import window (*note: This is important as this will help in reading the first row of the .csv as a header) > Import the file 




Task 4: Check for Error

SELECT * FROM world;

(This will help in checking if all the data is imported properly. In case an error is displayed, it means there is some discrepancy in the number of columns in table created and number of columns in the file. There may also be error in the CONSTRAINTS imposed and the data present in the table.)




Task 5: Choose the city with where average temperature range between 45 and 65, while average commute time is less than 60, and is in the top 15 in happiness ranking.

Solution: 
SELECT city_name FROM world
WHERE avg_temp BETWEEN 45 AND 65
	 AND avg_commute < 60
         AND happiness_ranking < 15
